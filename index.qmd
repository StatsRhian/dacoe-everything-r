<!-- TODO split into two images and check with Sally & Craig -->


## Packages ðŸ“¦

- Over 21,000 on CRAN
- Many more on GitHub
- [Diverse topics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

## Who uses R?

<!-- TODO example of projects in NHS --->

NHS-R Community - more about them later


## How do I get started? ðŸš€

1. [Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

1. [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

You can also [try it out in Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free)


::: {.aside}
If you're already a coder, there's a new IDE called [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) based on VS-Code which you might prefer.

::: {.notes}
Demo R in terminal vs RStudio
You don't need to install R for today's session
But I do have some snippets of code you can play with

# Working with data

## Who uses R?

## Examples of R projects in the NHS

## Silly R

## Goldacre Review / RAP

> It will be built using open source software for data management, analysis and visualisation (such as R or python) as this is standard, portable, and available to all for checking and re-use.



## Simple demo

```r
1 + 2
```

## Reading in data

- Show read_csv

Works SQL / databricks / databases / SPSS etc
API

## WebR

```{webr-r}
#| message: false
# Load library to manipualte
library(dplyr)

# Download simple dataset
canada_births_1991_2022 <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-01-09/canada_births_1991_2022.csv')
head(canada_births_1991_2022)
```

## testy

```{webr-r}

nrow(canada_births_1991_2022)
```


## Simple summaries

- summarise

## Group by then summarise


## Your turn

1. Instead of a mean, calculate the median for each group

1. Instead of sex, group by age

# Making pretty graphics

## Pretty plots

- BBC

- John burns 

- NHS plotthedots?

## Maps too!

- Free spatial 

::: {.notes}

No need for expensive GIS software

## Shiny apps 

https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/

# Quarto

These slides were made in Quarto!

## Reports

## Parameterisation

## Dashboards

## Can I trust R?

- All code is open

- Tools for validation (used in Pharma)

- Testing

## Using R as an organisation (Could expand?)

- Paids tools liek Worbench to standarise install
- PPM to
- Connect
