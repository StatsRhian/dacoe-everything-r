## What is R?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='60%'}

- A programming language
- About [30 years old](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/misc/timeline/)

## Why use R?

:::{.incremental}
- Free & open-source
- Cross-platform
- Diverse ecosystem of packages
- Write your own functions RAP
- Excellent support for statistical modelling
- Professional graphics
- Students learn R
- Friendly community 💜
:::

::: {.notes}
Many of the statistical models were written by the statisticans who developed the methods.

<!-- TODO split into two images and check with Sally & Craig -->


## Packages 📦

- Over 21,000 on CRAN
- Many more on GitHub
- [Diverse topics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

## Who uses R?

<!-- TODO example of projects in NHS --->

NHS-R Community - more about them later


## How do I get started? 🚀

1. [Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

1. [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

You can also [try it out in Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free)


::: {.aside}
If you're already a coder, there's a new IDE called [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) based on VS-Code which you might prefer.

:::

::: {.notes}
Demo R in terminal vs RStudio
You don't need to install R for today's session
But I do have some snippets of code you can play with

## Who uses R?



## Can it work with other tools?


## Examples of R projects in the NHS

## Silly R

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines ⭐

> It will be built using open source software for data management, analysis and visualisation (such as R or python) as this is standard, portable, and available to all for checking and re-use.

## Length of Stay data

```{r, setup R}
#| echo: false
library("dplyr")

los_data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StatsRhian/dacoe-everything-r/refs/heads/main/LOS_data.csv')
reactable::reactable(los_data)
```

:::{.notes}
Fictional data, adapted from {NHSRdatasets}
We might want to ask questions such as
- Which area has the most patients?
- What is the longest length of stay in the data?
- Is there a correlation between age and length of stay?
:::

## Load in data

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
# Load library to manipulate
library(dplyr)

# Download simple dataset
los_data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StatsRhian/dacoe-everything-r/refs/heads/main/LOS_data.csv')
head(los_data)
```

## Watch me 👀

```{r}
#| echo: true
# How many rows?
nrow(los_data)

# How old is the oldest person in the dataset?
max(los_data$Age)

# Whats the mean length of stay?
mean(los_data$LOS)
```

## Your turn 💻

Change the code below and click _Run_

```{webr-r}
# How many columns?
nrow(los_data)

# How old is the oldest person in the dataset?
max(los_data$Age)

# Whats the median length of stay?
mean(los_data$LOS)

```

::: {.callout-important}
Capitalisation matters!
:::

## Watch me 👀

What is the mean length of stay for each sex?
```{r}
#| echo: true
los_data |>
  group_by(Sex) |>
  summarise(mean_los = mean(LOS))
```

## Your turn 💻

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
# Calculate the median length of stay for each Area

names(los_data) # Reminder of the column names

los_data |>
  group_by(SOMETHING) |>
  summarise(median_los = median(SOMETHING))
```

::: {.callout-note}
Feel free to try grouping by other variables, or using other summarisation functions e.g. `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sd()`

  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = LOS)) +

```

1. Change the the colour of the points to "blue"

1. Add the line `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`^[You'll need a `+` at the end of the previous line]

## We can make maps too


```{r}
# Map of UK ICB coloured by something ?

# Hello quarto 👋

## What is quarto?

![](img/quarto.jpg){fig-alt="The quarto logo: A circle cut into four quadrants next to the word quarto"}

> An **open-source** scientific and technical **publishing** system

![Artwork from "Hello, Quarto" keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustrated by Allison Horst.](img/quarto-flow.png){fig-alt="A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto."}

## Automating reports

::: {.incremental}
- The data was wrong - can you re-run the analysis?
- Your manager loves it - can you do it for another region?
- Next month - do it all again.


There must be a better way

:::

## Example report

![](img/ne-april.png)

[statsrhian.github.io/example-quarto-report/example-report.html](https://statsrhian.github.io/example-quarto-report/example-report.html)

## Template based-reports

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1-8|6-8|2-3"
---
title: "NHS Workforce Statistics for `r params$ics_name`"
subtitle: "Data for `r params$month_year`"
author: "Maria Garcia"
date: "2023-09-28"
params:
  ics_name: "North East and North Cumbria"
  month_year: "April 2023"
---
```

## Interweave text and code 🧶

. . .

__Read in the data__

```{r}
#| eval: false
filename = glue("NHS Workforce Statistics, {params$month_year} England and Organisation.xlsx")
```

. . .

 __Clean the data__

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
#| eval: false 
staff_group = 
  staff_group |>
  filter(`ICS name` == params$ics_name) |>
  select(`Organisation name`, `Total`,
         `HCHS Doctors`, `Nurses & health visitors`,
         `Midwives`, `Ambulance staff`) 
```

. . . 

__Add insight__
```{r}
#| eval: false
The table below shows the total number of doctors and nurses for each organisation within `r params$ics_name`. We can see that the organisation with the most midwives is the `r pull(max_midwives, "Organisation name")` with `r round(max_midwives$Midwives)` staff.
```

## Re-run next month

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
---
title: "NHS Workforce Statistics for `r params$ics_name`"
subtitle: "Data for `r params$month_year`"
author: "Maria Garcia"
date: "2023-09-28"
params:
  ics_name: "North East and North Cumbria"
  month_year: "May 2023"
```

##  {background-image="img/ne-may.png"}

## Report a different region

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "7"
---
title: "NHS Workforce Statistics for `r params$ics_name`"
subtitle: "Data for `r params$month_year`"
author: "Maria Garcia"
date: "2023-09-28"
params:

  month_year: "May 2023"
```
